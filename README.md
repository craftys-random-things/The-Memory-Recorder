# The Memory Recorder

## Inspiration
Empathy is the foundation of community; people tend to not like jerks who do not understand them and cause them unnecessary harm without understanding their situation. I was annoying by this cycle found in society, as I've experienced it myself: I have a history with depression, and people would always tell me things like, "get over it," or, "just choose happiness," when they didn't understand the reality of depression and how fatigue and low mood could affect your life so drastically. I was inspired by the research that reading fiction helps increase empathy, so I tried a slightly different approach in making an interactive website. 

## What it does
No, it does not actually record your memories, but you are able to experience those of others. _Kind of._ It's a low budget version of that. There is currently one memory, and you experience the memory through an audio-based RPG (role-playing game) approach. Several times, player choices will come up to illustrate the potential choices someone in that hard situation might have to make. There is an illusion of choice, though, to show how easy it is to find yourself between a rock and a hard place, and not be able to make a good decision due to a number of factors.

## How I built it
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Replit. 

## Challenges I ran into
Time management. I underestimated the amount of time I would need and how much I would have to debug. I had to cut out a lot of features I wanted to include, such as background music that would've enhanced the project, due to a lack of time.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of finishing what I did in this short amount of time during the hackathon. 

## What I learned
I learnt a lot about JavaScript, such as using asynchronous functions and integrating JavaScript into websites.

## What's next for The Memory Recorder
I would love to polish the project code, audio, and maybe add some visuals and more memories. If there is enough interest, I may host it on a proper website instead of just on Replit.
